# Rect-Cavity-Resonator-Q-calculator
This project is related to ELC3050 course of antennas and waveguides, 3<sup>rd</sup> year communications Dept. of Cairo Uni.
> ## _Specifications_
The program that computes the quality factor of a specific rectangular cavity resonator at its first 2 resonances. The program takes the conductivity of the waveguide metal, relative permittivity and loss tangent of filling material, and the waveguide dimensions 
and gives out the resonance frequency, resonance bandwidth and the quality factor of resonator at the first 2 resonances.

> ## _Finally_
I have also included the report file incuding all the hand analysis, which i enjoyed doing so much, feel free to copy it as you want, or do it from scratch if you like suffering
<br>Last but not least, I've also included the antenna project files, both the schematic and the report docx. Feel free to contact me if you need any further help =)
